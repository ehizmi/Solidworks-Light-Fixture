# Solidworks- Light Fixture

# Purpose
The beginning part of this project was apart of a class assignment, where the end goal was to create just the part. I wanted to go beyond and learn more about crucial parts of the software, so I decided to introduce variables and a design study to optimize the part I made. 

# Variable Use
Variables were introduced for almost every measurement and feature of this part, including how many ribs, the height of the overal fixture, and the length. 

# Design Study
In order to perform a design study, a static study was first completed. This simulated force on the sides of the light fixture, simulating if the fixture fell on the ground how much stress the part could take before failing. In order to optimize the design, I had 48 different combinations of the variables, with the goal of the study to minimize stress. 

# Conclusion 
The design study was successful as there was an optimum design, where a screenshot of it is included in the files, as well as the file for the part itself. I have further increased my knowledge of the software as I can comfortably use the design study, which can involve introducing sensors, goals, static studies, and much more.
